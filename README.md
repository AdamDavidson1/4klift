4klift (Forklift) Framework
---------------------------

4klift is a set of PHP components for developing highly available,
redundant and scalable web sites or services on top of Apache Cassandra.

4klift is well suited for server side applications requiring greater than
99.99% service availability while also being able to withstand up to millions
of read and write operations per second thanks to Apache Cassandra.

This framework of components can be used together or individually. Many
components may be used individually in a variety of other frameworks, including
Symfony, Silex, Laraval and Drupal.
